# Intrepid-Explorer

This is a project I decided to make in my spare time during the Christmas holidays of 2023/2024. My family and I were supposed to go travelling, but instead some of us got COVID and so had to stay home. Hence, the inspiration for this project stems from the yearning of wanting to travel the world, but only being able to do so through a computer screen.
